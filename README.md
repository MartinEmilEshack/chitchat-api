# ChitChat

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

### Details:

* Ruby version ~> 5.0.0

* System dependencies  
  `MySQL - Redis - RabbitMQ - Elasticsearch` checkout `docker-compose.yml` for more info.

* Configuration  
  checkout `.env.example` I also added a `.env` file for a demo

## Instructions  

run  
``` 
$ docker compose up 
```  
..wait for eternity  
then in a new terminal run these commands
```
$ docker compose exec chitchat-api rails db:migrate
$ docker compose exec chitchat-api rake consumers
```

The `rails db:migrate` should build the database tables  
The `rake consumers` should run the consumer workers, whom would persist the new chats and messages into the database and elasticsearch  

## Known Problem  

I've tried to connect the Elasticsearch client `elasticsearch-rails` to the `chitchat-search` container but It won't make the connection to the right host. It gives this error.  
```
Faraday::ConnectionFailed (Failed to open TCP connection to localhost:9200 (Cannot assign requested address - connect(2) for "localhost" port 9200)):
```
I've tried plenty of configurations and searched a lot for answers. I've even tried to connect while disabling the user and password. but I couldn't make it. However the insertion of messages and searching logic is implemented. It just won't work. I would really appreciate any comments regarding this issue.  

#### Have fun
